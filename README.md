# CyberChef-Bake

This will be a script which provides a command-line interface to process local files through a running instance of [CyberChef-server](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef-server/).

It uses virtual environments, so remember to
    source env/bin/activate
before you start working, and
    deactivate
when complete.
